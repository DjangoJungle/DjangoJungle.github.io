Welcome!

I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in LLM reasoning and information representation (text, tables, images, etc.) for AI. In simple terms, my ambition is to enable AI to understand more, so it can, in turn, help us gain deeper insights.

Throughout my journey in research, I've been fortunate to receive guidance from exceptional and supportive mentors. At Zhejiang University, I am a research intern at [SuDIS Lab](https://sudis-zju.github.io/en/), under the supervision of [Prof. Huan Li](https://longaspire.github.io/). Since last semester, I have also been collaborating with the [TMLR Group, HKBU](https://github.com/tmlr-group), working alongside [Dr. Zhanke Zhou](https://github.com/AndrewZhou924) and [Dr. Xiao Feng](https://github.com/KyrieXiao25) - Phd students of [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/).
